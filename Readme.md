# Machine Learning Project

## Introduction

A program that uses a neural network and a genetic algorithm to self-learn how to drive around a track over time, whilst avoiding collisions with the edges of the track and generated vehicles (dummy vehicles displayed in blue that simulate traffic).

## Requirements

A web browser that supports canvas (Chrome 4.0+, Internet Explorer 9.0+, Firefox 2.0+, Safari 3.1+ or Opera 9.0+), preferrably Chrome for maxiumum compatability.

## Installation

Unzip the file and run index.html.

## Usage

Open index.html on a browser.

## Configuration

A number of parameters can be configured:

* Toggle display of neural network visualisation
* Toggle display of raycasts
* Alter number of genomes per generation
* Alter the probability of a generated vehicle being spawned per frame
* Alter the time delay between two successive vehicles being spawned from a junction
* Alter the minumum number of generated vehicles on-screen at any one time
* Alter the number of neurons in the neural network
